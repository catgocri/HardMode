For those who are seeking a challenge. Hard Mode multiplies Potion Craft's difficulty by tenfold, giving you a nice challenge. All of the mods features are either toggleable or configurable, allowing you to customize your challenge! You can find the config file in **Potion Craft\BepInEx\Config.**

If anyone can get a legitimate Philosophers Stone with this mod enabled you earn our respect haha.
## Features
The features this mod adds are:
- Merchants are always selling at higher prices. (Configurable & Toggleable)
- Daily gold tax of 5% after reaching 500 gold. (Configurable & Toggleable)
- Highlander mode, adding too many of one ingredient fails the potion. (Configurable & Toggleable)
- Bone zones are lethal. (Toggleable)
- Less ingredients from garden. (Toggleable)
- Potion Deterioration. This causes your potion to lose health when it moves through the map. (Configurable & Toggleable)
- As a follow up to that pouring your base will heal the potion. (Configurable & Toggleable)
- Potion health is directly correlated with potion tier. You will need health for higher tiers, keep yer potions healthy. (Configurable & Toggleable)
## Known Bugs
- Game shows that you have been taxed 5 gold on startup (even though you haven't).
## Installation
This mod uses BepInEx 5! BepInEx is a mod loader, basically it is what puts the edited code into the game.
- Install [BepInEx 5](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) and extract the zip file.
- Drag the extracted folder into your Potion Craft folder, you should be able to find the Potion Craft folder at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Potion Craft`
- Run Potion Craft once with BepInEx installed.
- Download the mod from the [GitHub](https://github.com/catgocri/HardMode/releases) page.
- Drag `potioncraft-hardmode.dll` into `Potion Craft\BepInEx\Plugins`
- You are good to go!
## Deinstallation
Uninstalling this mod is as easy as deleting one file, you don't even need to delete [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases)!
- Navigate to `Potion Craft\BepInEx\Plugins`
- Remove `potioncraft-hardmode.dll` from the folder.
- You are done!
